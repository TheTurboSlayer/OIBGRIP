            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.
            He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. 
            He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, 
            mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.
            [1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
            [2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998,
            the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
            <br>

            Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. 
            Widely referred to as the "People's President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term.
            He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.
            <br>
            <br>
            While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.
            [7] Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.

            After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development 
            Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming
            a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice 
            of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] In 1969, Kalam was transferred
            to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully 
            deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.
            [1] In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.

            Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, 
            surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.

            <br>

            On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, 
            expressed that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President,[39][40] and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy. 
            After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, 
            leaving the field clear.[43] Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature:

            <br>

                I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a message. 
                I was thinking what message I can give to the people of the country at this juncture.
            <br>
            On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee and his senior Cabinet colleagues.
            <br>
            The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002, in Parliament and the state assemblies, 
            with the media claiming that the election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's victory was a foregone conclusion; 
            the count was held on 18 July.[46] Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India in an easy victory, 
            and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in on 25 July.[48] Kalam was the third President of India to have been honoured 
            with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, before becoming the President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Zakir Hussain (1963) were 
            the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became the President of India.[49] He was also the first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy 
            Rashtrapati Bhawan.

            After leaving office, Kalam became a visiting professor at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, 
            and the Indian Institute of Management Indore; an honorary fellow of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore; 
            chancellor of the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology Thiruvananthapuram; professor of Aerospace Engineering at Anna University; 
            and an adjunct at many other academic and research institutions across India. 
            He taught information technology at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, and technology at Banaras Hindu University and Anna University.
